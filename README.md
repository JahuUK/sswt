# Weight and Calorie Tracker

## Overview
The Weight and Calorie Tracker application is a simple, user-friendly web app designed to help individuals monitor their weight and calorie intake over time. By providing tools to log data and visualize trends, built initially so I could keep track of my own calorie intake and weight loss... I decided to expand the access of this out to GitHub in case anybody wants to use something similar. Currently the 'production' environment for this is located at https://wt.jahu.uk.

## Features
- **Weight Tracker**: Log and view weight entries over time.
- **Calorie History**: Keep a history of daily calorie intake.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualize trends in weight and calorie data through interactive charts.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Collapsible Lists**: Easily view or hide weight history entries for better navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for efficient server-side processing.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for frontend and backend functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **Chart.js (or similar library)**: To create dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Why This App Was Created
This application was developed to:
1. **Simplify Health Tracking**: I just wanted a place to track my weight and calorie in take. I didn't care about barcode scanning, curated lists or whatever. I am under the impression a tool like this likely already exists, but wanted to do something I was personally invested in as it'd mean me I'd more than likely stick to my new positive health routine.
2. **Promote Health Awareness**: Tracking trends over time can motivate users to make informed decisions about their health.
3. **Learn and Experiment**: It cannot be stated enough though, this project is primarily an exploration of software and web development practices. This is all new to me so I wanted to have a small project that I could work on to busy myself in my spare time.

## How to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Adding authentication for secure and personalized tracking.
- Integrating additional health metrics like water intake or sleep tracking.
- Exporting data for offline analysis.
- Improving data input methods for a smoother user experience.
